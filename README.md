# group_chat
The aim of this project is to create a group chat system for students in the same college using Python sockets, which can only be accessed during lab sessions. The system will also have a file transfer feature, allowing students to share files with each other within the chat room.

To ensure the security and integrity of the chat system, only faculty members will be allowed to create chat rooms. This will prevent unauthorized users from accessing the chat system and ensure that the system is only used for academic purposes.

The group chat system will be built using Python sockets, which will allow for real-time communication between users. The system will have a simple user interface, making it easy for students to join and participate in the chat room.

The file transfer feature will allow students to share files with each other within the chat room. This will make it easy for students to collaborate on projects and share important academic resources.

Overall, this group chat system will provide a convenient and secure platform for students to communicate and collaborate with each other during lab sessions, helping them to succeed in their academic endeavors
